            <h2>Summary</h2> 
            <p> As a self-directed, hardworking Computer Engineering student, 
                I have collaboratively completed advanced projects involving 
                data structures, tutored undergraduates on electronics, and 
                applied my knowledge in real-life scenarios through clubs and 
                business ventures. 
            </p>
            <aside>
                <p> Academically and as a hobby, I love exploring the interface 
                    between hardware and software and want to use my skills to 
                    change the world in a meaningful way.

            <h2>Interesting Things About Me</h2>
            <p>I live by Nelson Mandelaâ€™s words:</p>
            <div>
                <p> "It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, 
                    especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. 
                    You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will 
                    appreciate your leadership."
                </p>
